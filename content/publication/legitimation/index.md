abstract: Over the past 15 years, the relationship between illiberal European actors and Russia has become increasingly intertwined. Russia has cultivated these relationships, viewing illiberal actors as a means of influencing Europe. Despite the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which could have been considered a critical juncture, some European parties and politicians did not sever their connections with Russia. This paper addresses this conundrum, focusing on how illiberal Central European actors, exemplified by the FPÖ and Hungary's Fidesz, continue to reference Russia in their rhetoric, and how Russian state rhetoric, represented by state-controlled media, constructs its discourse on Hungary and Austria in response. Through a multi-method analysis, the paper argues that European illiberal parties and Russia engage in mutual legitimation strategies, leveraging shared narratives to bolster their positions domestically and internationally. The paper identifies common argumentative frames used by illiberal actors, highlighting the intertwined nature of their legitimation strategies.
