title: ¿Propaganda o programa? El desafío deliberativo en las elecciones 2025
summary: We analyse three presidential debates during the first round of the presidential election in Chile to detect the level of use of propaganda and persuasion techniques by each candidate, indicating the more or less deliberative levels of their discourse. Jara was by far the most proactive, Kast was the one who used propaganda techniques the most, and Matthei was the one who deployed the most diverse repertoire of techniques.
